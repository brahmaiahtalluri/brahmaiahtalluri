This repository contains Java programs developed as part of the Stage 1 challenge in the TandemLoop selection process. The projects demonstrate fundamental programming skills including control flow, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

Programming Language : Java (JDK 8+)

Description of Programs;

Problem_1.java
A simple calculator program that accepts two numbers and an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) from the user. The program performs the specified operation and prints the result, including handling division by zero and invalid operation inputs.

Problem_2.java
Reads an integer input and prints a sequence of numbers from 0 up to the input value minus one. Demonstrates loop and input handling in Java.

Problem_3.java
Reads an integer and prints a series of odd numbers based on the input. If the input is even, it adjusts the range accordingly. This program showcases conditional logic and loop usage.

Program_4.java
Counts how many numbers in a predefined array are multiples of integers 1 through 9 and prints the counts in a formatted style. This program demonstrates iteration, conditionals, and array handling.
